          <h2>Chapter 4 – Achieve Your Goals</h2>
          <p>This chapter emphasizes the power of writing down your goals. It teaches that goals provide clarity, direction, and motivation. Instead of vague wishes, you need specific, measurable, time-bound goals. Jim Rohn notes that it’s not just the achievement of the goal that matters, but who you become in the process.</p>
          <div class="reflection">
            <h3>Personal Reflection:</h3>
            <p>I realize that I often keep my goals in my head, which makes them easy to ignore. From now on, I plan to write out clear long-term and short-term goals, especially for my studies, career, and personal growth. Breaking them down into smaller steps will help me stay focused and motivated.</p>

        <!-- Chapter 5 -->
        <div class="card" id="chapter5">
          <h2>Chapter 5 – The Proper Use of Time</h2>
          <p>This chapter focuses on time management. Time is our most limited and precious resource. Jim Rohn compares the pain of discipline with the pain of regret, emphasizing that it’s better to act now than to suffer later. Successful people prioritize what matters most and avoid distractions.</p>
          <div class="reflection">
            <h3>Personal Reflection:</h3>
            <p>I've noticed that I waste time on unimportant activities. I plan to use a daily planner or task list to identify my top priorities. I will also reduce distractions like social media during my work time. Time management will help me achieve more in less time and reduce stress.</p>

        <!-- Chapter 6 -->
        <div class="card" id="chapter6">
          <h2>Chapter 6 – Surround Yourself With the Best People</h2>
          <p>This chapter teaches the importance of your social circle. The people you associate with influence your thoughts, habits, and future. To grow, you need to connect with people who inspire, challenge, and uplift you. Sometimes, it's necessary to limit time with negative or unmotivated individuals.</p>
          <div class="reflection">
            <h3>Personal Reflection:</h3>
            <p>This made me think about the people I regularly interact with. I want to build stronger connections with those who support my goals and distance myself from those who bring negativity. I also want to seek out mentors who can guide me professionally and personally.</p>

        <!-- Chapter 7 -->
        <div class="card" id="chapter7">
          <h2>Chapter 7 – Be a Lifelong Learner</h2>
          <p>Jim Rohn stresses the importance of self-education beyond school. Learning doesn’t stop after formal education—it’s a continuous journey. Reading, reflecting, and learning from others’ experiences are key ways to stay ahead and improve your life consistently.</p>
          <div class="reflection">
            <h3>Personal Reflection:</h3>
            <p>I’ve been too casual with learning outside of school. I want to start reading more personal development and business books. I will also take notes and reflect on what I learn, and maybe even keep a learning journal. This habit will help me grow into the person I aim to become.</p>
