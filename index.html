  <h1>Personality</h1>
  <div class="trait">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> My curiosity prompts me to look outside the classroom. When I learn something new, I question, research, and try to understand how it connects to the real world. This leads to deeper learning and more engagement in class.</li>

      <li><strong>Solution-Oriented:</strong> I enjoy solving problems, whether academic, technical, or real-life. I strive to understand why things work, not just what the right answer is. This mindset helps me perform better in analytical subjects like math and science.</li>

      <li><strong>Competitive Nature:</strong> I thrive in competitive environments. Whether itâ€™s a quiz or challenge, I stay focused and prepare thoroughly. I view failures as motivation to improve and push harder.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
      <p>
        My favorite quote comes from the most important man to walk the earth, Jesus, in Mark 10:43:<br>
        <em>"Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I love this verse because in the world, greatness is often defined by power or status. But Jesus made it clear:
        true leaders serve others, put people first, and lead through humility.

      <h3>But Why Jesus?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I am a religious person and believe in God and Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>I believe God sent His only Son, Jesus, to die for our sins (John 3:16).</li>
        <li>Jesus is my hero because of His incredible love for humanity.</li>
        <li>He left His place in heaven to enter a world of suffering and pain (Philippians 2:5â€“8).</li>
        <li>Jesus was beaten, mocked, and ultimately crucified (Matthew 27:27â€“31; Luke 23:33â€“34).</li>
        <li>Isaiah 52:14 says He was beaten so badly He was unrecognizable.</li>
        <li>He endured this for the very people who called for His death (Luke 23:21).</li>
        <li>Though innocent, He died a criminalâ€™s death (1 Peter 2:22â€“24).</li>
        <li>His love is unmatched â€” He died not only for His friends but for His enemies too (Romans 5:6â€“8; John 15:13).</li>
      </ul>
